# Weather App
This app was an exercise in retreiving data from another application's API. 

A traveller will be presented with a weather dashboard that shows the 5-day forecast. The user may enter the name of their desired destinations; the list of cities will be saved to the page for retrieval at the user's convenience. Icons provide a visual representation of weather conditions. 

The OpenWeather API is the source of the data used in this app.
